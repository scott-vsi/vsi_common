# NAME
#   just -- J.U.S.T. uncomplicated simple tasking
# AUTHOR
#   Andy Neff
# PURPOSE
#   When working on a project, it often becomes necessary to run many long 
#   commands. Just like make, just gives an easy way to create a set of targets
#   to execute easily. Unlike a makefile, it has two key distinctions
#     * It's not a makefile. Bash is easier than make for simple tasks
#     * It works on Windows (when git->bash is installed),  MacOS (bash 3.2)
#       and Linux with no additional dependencies.
# DESCRIPTION
#   just supports a number of features:
#   * Tab completion (.just)
#   * Comment generated help
#   * Subcommands
#   * Executing multiple targets at once
# USAGE
#   just help
# SEE ALSO
#   Justfile, .just

#****F* just/Justfile
# NAME
#   Justfile -- Like the Makefile for just
# PURPOSE
#   The file sourced by just. The primary purpose of the Justfile is to define
#   the function caseify. caseify should try to match $1 and the number of 
#   additional arguments used should be added to extra_args
# EXAMPLE
#   #!/usr/bin/false
#   source_environment_files "${CWD}/my_project_name.env"
#
#   function caseify()
#   {
#     local just_arg=$1
#     shift 1
#     case ${just_arg} in
#       foo) #ls foo files
#         ls
#         ;;
#       two) # Target with two arguments
#         echo $1 $2
#         extra_args+=2
#       group) # Two groups of args
#         get_args ${@+"${@}"}
#         echo ${args+"${args[@]}"}
#         get_additional_args ${@+"${@}"}
#         echo ${args+"${args[@]}"}
#       # When a target starts with an _, it is hidden and is not included in 
#       # tab complete. It remains hidden from help unless a help comment is 
#       # added
#       _hidden)
#         ;; 
#       *) 
#         defaultify "${just_arg}" ${@+"${@}"} 
#         ;;
#     esac
#   }
# SEE ALSO
#   source_environment_files, get_extra_args

#****F* just/.just
# NAME
#   .just -- Tab completion script
# USAGE
#   source .just
# SYNOPSIS
#   Creates auto complete suggestions based on parsing the Justfile case 
#   statements. 
#
#   To add customized tab completions, add a .just script next to project
#   Justfile. Write what would normally go inside the complete function to the
#   .just file (without the function header). This file will be sourced every 
#   complete after the just_commands, _just_subcommands, _just_subcommands 
#   arrays are populated.
#***

#****m* just/help
# NAME
#   just help -- Print help 
# SYNOPSIS
#   Print out basic help based on the comments it the Justfile
# EXAMPLE
#   Basic example: 
#     foo) # Runs the foo routine
#   Multiple targets at once:
#     cat | dog) # Routine for cats and dogs
#   Multiple targets:
#     # cat) # Comment for cat
#     cat |\
#     dog) # Routine for dogs
#   Subcommand/subtarget example:
#     foo_cat) # Runs the foo routine for cat
#     foo_dog) # Runs the foo routine for dog
#   Commenting extra help targets:
#     # foo_a) # Runs the foo routine for a
#     # foo_b) # Runs the foo routine for b
#     foo_*)
#     ## foo_c) # Runs the foo routine for c, but don't tell anyone
#   The foo_a and foo_b are added to tab complete and help, but using more than
#   one # ignores it all together. So foo_c is ignored
# NOTES
#   The help message can only be one line long, but can be as long as needed
#
#   The same mechanism populates help and tab completion

#****id* just/JUST_IN_SCRIPT
# NAME
#   JUST_IN_SCRIPT - Unexported variable to indicated sources by just
# DESCRIPTION
#   Useful in other scripts for determining if they are being sourced by just or
#   not.
# USAGE
#   Currently one use of this is dual purposing a file, so that it behaves 
#   differently when sourced by just or by a user on the prompts
